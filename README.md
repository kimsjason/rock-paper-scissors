# rock-paper-scissors

This is a mini-project in the Foundations curriculum of The Odin Project. For the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, this project will take a user input and evaluate it against the computer's randomly selected choice. The game will consist of five rounds, after which a winner will be declared.

All outputs will be displayed on the console for now. A GUI may be developed in a later lesson.
